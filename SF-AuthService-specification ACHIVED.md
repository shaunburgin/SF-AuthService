**StudioFlow Auth Service Module Specification**

---

## **Overview**

The StudioFlow Auth Service provides centralized authentication and authorization for all modules in the StudioFlow application. Using a microservices architecture on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), this service authenticates users, associates them with a `customer_id`, issues JWTs, and enforces access control across modules by restricting data access to the user's specific `customer_id`.

### **Terminology**

- **Access Token**: A token used to authenticate and authorize API requests. In this specification, access tokens are implemented as JWTs.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Implemented as opaque strings.

### **Objectives**

1. **Scalable, Secure Authentication**: Provide a secure authentication system for users to access the StudioFlow application.
2. **Multi-Environment Setup**: Support DEV, UAT, and PRD environments, deployed with Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
3. **Token-Based Access Control**: Issue JWTs containing user and customer information, enabling other modules to restrict access by `customer_id`.
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Maintain cost-effective design, balancing performance with GCP resource usage.

---

## **Technology Stack and Architecture Overview**

The StudioFlow Auth Service leverages Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services to provide secure, scalable authentication and access control. Key components ensure environment isolation, resource optimization, and simplified deployment using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

### **Core Components**

1. **Roles and Responsibilities**:
   - **Identity Platform**:
     - Handles primary user authentication (e.g., verifying credentials like username and password).
     - Issues initial access tokens after successful authentication.
     - Maintains user profiles and custom claims used by the Auth Service.
   - **Auth Service**:
     - Manages token validation, refresh, and revocation.
     - Applies custom logic for access control and token lifecycle, including checking Firestore for revoked tokens.
     - Issues new refresh tokens and manages token rotation.
2. **Identity Platform**: Centralized authentication provider that handles user authentication and issues JWTs. Each JWT includes user information and `customer_id` for data access control across modules
3. **Cloud Functions**: Stateless, serverless functions handle custom authentication logic, including token validation and user management, allowing secure and cost-effective compute.
4. **User Management and Password Reset**
   - **User Maintenance**: All user maintenance, including creation, deletion, and role assignment, will be handled directly within Google Cloud Platformâ€™s Identity Platform using either the Firebase Console, Google Cloud Console, or Identity Platform Admin SDK. No dedicated interface for user management is required at this point.
   - **Password Reset**: Password resets will be managed directly through Identity Platform, with administrators responsible for initiating resets:
      - Users are instructed to contact an administrator for password reset requests.
      - Administrators can initiate password reset emails for users directly from the console.
5. **Firestore**: Stores user metadata such as `customer_id`, roles, and permissions, enabling easy lookup for access control and auditing.
   - **Local Emulation for Testing**: Use the **Firebase Local Emulator Suite** to test Firestore interactions, Cloud Functions, and Authentication locally, providing a safe and controlled environment for development and testing.
6. **Cloud Logging & Monitoring**: Provides real-time logging and metrics to track usage patterns, monitor security, and detect anomalies. Logging configurations will vary by environment with DEV, UAT and PRD each having specific log retention and detail levels to match operational needs.
7. **Terraform (IaC)**: Manages the setup of DEV, UAT, and PRD environments using **separate GCP projects for each environment**, ensuring isolation, simplifying IAM management, and enhancing security. Infrastructure is defined using IaC scripts for automation.
   - **Environment Isolation**: Use Terraform scripts to automate the creation and management of separate GCP projects for each environment (DEV, UAT, PRD), enhancing security and simplifying IAM management.
8. **Authentication SDK**: A software development kit that provides authentication functionalities, allowing applications to securely interact with the Auth Service APIs. The SDK handles communication with the Auth Service, token management, and ensures consistent security practices across all modules in the StudioFlow application.
9. **CI/CD Integration**: Incorporate Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines using tools like **Cloud Build**, **GitHub Actions**, or **GitLab CI/CD** to automate testing, linting, and deployments, ensuring consistent and reliable releases.
10. **Global Error Handling and Exception Management**
    1. **Centralized Error Logging**: 
       - Capture and log errors across the Auth Service and SDK using Google Cloud Logging for server-side errors and a client-side logging mechanism for SDK errors.
    2. **Global Error Handling in the Auth Service**:
       - Implement interceptors in Cloud Functions and return standardized error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.
    3. **Error Handling in the SDK**:
       - Implement a global error handler, retry logic for transient errors, and provide user-friendly error messages.
    4. **Security and Privacy Considerations**:
       - Mask sensitive data in logs and user-facing error messages to maintain security and privacy.

### **Key Architecture Aspects**

1. **Authentication and Token Management**: Identity Platform issues JWTs that include necessary user and `customer_id` details, ensuring seamless access control across microservices while avoiding direct data access between customers.
2. **Authorization Enforcement**: Tokens include `customer_id`, enabling each module to enforce data restrictions based on this identifier.
3. **Environment Isolation**: Use Terraform to manage separate GCP projects for DEV, UAT, and PRD environments, utilizing resource naming conventions and IAM policies to ensure isolation and security.
4. **Handling Network Issues**: Authentication services require network connectivity to function. In case of network issues, the application will gracefully handle errors and inform users that authentication actions cannot be performed until connectivity is restored.
5. **Centralized Authentication Logic via SDK**: The Authentication SDK provides a centralized implementation of authentication logic, ensuring consistent security practices across all modules while allowing each application to develop its own frontend UI.
6. **Single Source of Truth**: The Auth Service acts as the single source of truth for authentication and authorization. All modules rely solely on the Auth Service to manage user data and permissions, ensuring consistency and security.
7. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment**: Integrate CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, linting, and deployments, ensuring code quality and rapid delivery.

### **JWT Token Structure and Claims**

The JWTs issued by the Identity Platform will include both standard and custom claims to provide necessary user information.

- **Signing Algorithm**: `RS256` (RSA Signature with SHA-256)

- **Public Key Access**: The public key for verifying JWTs will be available at `https://auth.studioflow.com/.well-known/jwks.json`

- **JWT Payload Structure**:

  - **For Customer User**:
    ```json
    {
      "iss": "https://auth.studioflow.com",
      "sub": "user_id_value",
      "aud": "studioflow_clients",
      "exp": 1625247600,
      "iat": 1625244000,
      "customer_id": "customer_id_value",
      "roles": ["customer_user"]
    }
    ```
  - **For Studio Admin**:
    ```json
    {
      "iss": "https://auth.studioflow.com",
      "sub": "user_id_value",
      "aud": "studioflow_clients",
      "exp": 1625247600,
      "iat": 1625244000,
      "roles": ["studio_admin"]
    }
    ```

- **Claims Explanation**:

  - `iss` (Issuer): The issuing authority (`https://auth.studioflow.com`).
  - `sub` (Subject): The user's unique identifier (user_id).
  - `aud` (Audience): Intended recipients (`studioflow_clients`).
  - `exp` (Expiration Time): Token expiration timestamp (in Unix epoch time).
  - `iat` (Issued At): Token issuance timestamp.
  - `customer_id`: Custom claim representing the user's associated customer.
  - `roles`: Array of roles assigned to the user.


## **Access Control and Authorization**

### **Overview**
The Access Control Logic enforces permissions and data access restrictions based on user roles (`studio_admin`, `customer_user`).

### **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

#### **Roles and Permissions**
- **`studio_admin`**
  - **Description**: Ful access to all functions in the application.

- **`customer_user`**
  - **Description**: Users associated with a specific customer.
  - **Access Rights**:
    - Access restricted to data associated with their `customer_id`.
    - Cannot access administrative functions or data from other customers.


### **User Creation and Management**

- **Studio Admin User Creation**:
  - `customer_id` should be omitted or set to `null`.
  - Roles should include `studio_admin`.

- **Customer User Creation**:
  - `customer_id` is required.
  - Roles should include `customer_user`.

- **Validation Rules**:
  - Enforce that `customer_user` roles cannot be assigned without a `customer_id`.
  - Prevent `studio_admin` users from being assigned a `customer_id`.

### **Edge Cases and Security Considerations**
- **Missing `customer_id` for `customer_user`**:
  - Deny access and return an error indicating that the user profile is misconfigured.

---


## **API Contracts**
APIs allow other modules to authenticate users, retrieve JWTs, and enforce access control by `customer_id`. All time values, including expires_in, are expressed in seconds.

### **Standard Error Response Format**
All API endpoints will return errors in the following standardized format:

- **Error Response**:
All error responses will follow the standardized JSON structure below for success and error responses to ensure consistency across modules.

  ```json
  {
    "error": {
      "code": "string",
      "message": "string",
      "details": "string (optional)"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Fields**:
  - `error.code`: A string representing the error code, e.g., `INVALID_CREDENTIALS`, `TOKEN_EXPIRED`.
  - `error.message`: A human-readable message describing the error.
  - `error.details`: Additional details or context about the error (optional).

### **Standard HTTP Status Codes and Error Codes**

The following HTTP status codes and corresponding error codes are used across all API endpoints:

- **400 Bad Request**:
  - **Error Codes**:
    - `INVALID_REQUEST`: The request format is invalid or missing required parameters.
    - `INVALID_INPUT`: Input data validation failed (e.g., invalid email format, password criteria not met).
- **401 Unauthorized**:
  - **Error Codes**:
    - `INVALID_CREDENTIALS`: Incorrect username or password.
    - `INVALID_TOKEN`: The provided token is invalid or malformed.
    - `TOKEN_EXPIRED`: The token has expired.
    - `INVALID_REFRESH_TOKEN`: The refresh token is invalid or expired.
- **403 Forbidden**:
  - **Error Codes**:
    - `ACCOUNT_LOCKED`: User account is locked due to multiple failed login attempts.
    - `REFRESH_NOT_ALLOWED`: User account is restricted from refreshing tokens.
- **429 Too Many Requests**:
  - **Error Codes**:
    - `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`: The rate limit has been exceeded for the user account.
- **500 Internal Server Error**:
  - **Error Codes**:
    - `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`: An unexpected error occurred on the server side.

**Note**: All error responses will include the appropriate HTTP status code and adhere to the standard error response format defined above.

### **Transmission and Storage of Tokens**

- **Token Transmission**:
  - **Access Token**:
    - Returned in the **response body** as `"access_token"` for clarity and ease of access.
  - **Refresh Token**:
    - Transmitted and stored in a **secure, HTTP-only cookie** with `SameSite=Strict` attribute to prevent JavaScript access and protect against XSS and CSRF attacks.

  *Note: Storing the refresh token in an HTTP-only cookie enhances security by preventing client-side scripts from accessing it.*

- **Example Success Response**:
  - **Response Headers**:
    ```http
    Set-Cookie: refresh_token=<refresh_token_value>; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict
    ```
  - **JSON Response Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "access_token": "<access_token_value>",
      "expires_in": 3600
    }
    ```
  *Note: The access token is returned in the response body, while the refresh token is securely stored via an HTTP-only cookie.*

- **Client-Side Storage**:
  - **Access Token**:
    - Store securely in memory on the client side and avoid persistence to reduce exposure.
  - **Refresh Token**:
    - Managed by the browser via the HTTP-only cookie and not accessible through JavaScript.
  *Note: Storing access tokens in memory reduces XSS risks, and managing refresh tokens via cookies prevents CSRF attacks.*

- **Security Considerations**:
  - Avoid storing tokens in local storage or other insecure locations.
  - Implement CSRF protections using secure HTTP-only cookies for the refresh token.

### **Refresh Token Format and Validation Process**

- **Format**: 
  - Refresh tokens are opaque tokens, represented as securely generated random strings. They are not JWTs and do not contain user claims. 

- **Validation Process**:
  - **Revocation Check**: Each time a refresh token is used, the Auth Service checks Firestore for a revocation entry tied to the token ID. If found, the token is invalidated, and the refresh request is denied.
  - **Expiration Check**: Refresh tokens have a maximum lifetime of 14 days. During each refresh request, the Auth Service checks the tokenâ€™s creation timestamp to ensure it is within this period.
  - **Rotation and Invalidated Tokens**: Upon successful refresh, a new refresh token is generated and stored in a secure, HTTP-only cookie. The old token is marked as invalid in Firestore, ensuring that only the latest token is usable.


### **1. POST /auth/login**
- **Description**: Authenticates a user and returns a JWTs.
- **Request**:
  - Body: `{ "username": "string", "password": "string" }`
- **Response**:

  - **Note**: Rate limiting is based on user account to avoid unintended denial of service to users behind shared IP addresses.
- **Security Best Practices**:
  - Enforce HTTPS for all endpoints.
  - Use short-lived tokens and manage signing keys using Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS).
  - **Token Lifetimes and Rotation**
    - **Access Token (`JWT`)**:
      - **Expiration Time**: 15 minutes.
      - **Usage**: Used for authenticating API requests.
      - **Renewal**: Must be refreshed using a valid refresh token upon expiration.
    - **Refresh Token**:
      - **Expiration Time**: 1209600 seconds (14 days).
      - **Usage**: Used to obtain new access tokens without re-authenticating.
      - **Rotation**: Refresh tokens are rotated upon each use. A new refresh token is issued and the old one invalidated.
      - **Revocation**: Refresh tokens can be revoked if suspicious activity is detected.
    - **Token Revocation Mechanism**:
      - The Auth Service maintains a blacklist of revoked tokens in Firestore.
      - Tokens are checked against the blacklist during authentication and refresh operations.
- **Secure Storage of Tokens**:
  - **Access Token**: Stored securely in memory on the client side to minimize exposure.
  - **Refresh Token**: Stored in a secure, HTTP-only cookie to prevent access via JavaScript.
- **Edge Cases**:

    - After `5` failed login attempts, lock the user account for `15 minutes`.
    - The account will automatically unlock after the lockout period.
    - **User Notification**: Notify the user via email about the lockout and when they can attempt to log in again.
- **Session Management**:
  - **Token Issuance**:
    - Upon successful login, the server issues both an access token and a refresh token.
  - **User Experience**:
    - If the refresh token has expired or is invalid, prompt the user to re-authenticate to obtain new tokens.
    -

    // Set custom claims for a user
    admin.auth().setCustomUserClaims(uid, {
      customer_id: 'customer_id_value',
      roles: ['admin', 'editor']
    })
    .then(() => {
      // Custom claims set successfully
    })
    .catch(error => {
      // Handle error
    });
    ```

- **When to Set Custom Claims**:

  - Upon user creation by an administrator.

  - When updating user roles or `customer_id`.

- **Usage in Tokens**:

  - Restrict access to authenticated users and specific Cloud Functions.
  - Ensure users can only access their own data based on `customer_id`.
  - Example Rule:

    ```javascript
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        match /users/{userId} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

---

### **Step 4: Cloud Functions for Authentication**

#### **4.1 Function Implementations**

- **Implement the Following Cloud Functions**:
  - **`loginUser`**:
    - Authenticates the user using Identity Platform.
    - Retrieves a JWT containing custom claims.
  - **`validateToken`**:
    - Validates JWTs.
    - Extracts `customer_id` and other claims.
  - **`refreshToken`**:
    - Issues new JWTs when old tokens expire.

### **Step 6: Development Workflow**

#### **6.1 Backend (Node.js Cloud Functions)**

- **Create and Test Locally**:
  - Implement Cloud Functions using a functional programming approach.
  - **Local Emulators**:
    - Use the **Firebase Local Emulator Suite** to emulate Cloud Functions, Firestore, and Authentication locally.
    - Test interactions without deploying to the cloud.
- **Debugging**:
  - Utilize VS Code's debugging features:
    - Set breakpoints.
    - Step through code.
    - Monitor variables and call stacks.
- **Code Organization**:
  - Structure code into modules for reusability and maintainability.

#### **6.2 Authentication SDK Development**

- **Language Support**:
  - Develop the SDK in **JavaScript**, targeting React and other JavaScript applications.
- **Core Functionality**:
   - Implement methods for:
      - `login()`
      - `logout()`
      - `refreshToken()`
      - Token management and storage.

- **Token Management and Storage in the Authentication SDK**:
   - **Access Token Storage**:
      - Stored in memory only, never in persistent storage (e.g., local storage or cookies).
      - Automatically cleared upon logout or session expiry to minimize exposure.

   - **Refresh Token Storage**:
      - Stored in a secure, HTTP-only, `SameSite=Strict` cookie to prevent unauthorized access and CSRF attacks.
      - The cookie is set with the `Secure` attribute to ensure it is only sent over HTTPS connections.

   - **Automatic Token Refresh and Rotation**:
      - The SDK checks the expiration time of the access token and automatically attempts to refresh it a few minutes before expiry, provided the refresh token is valid.
      - On each refresh, a new refresh token is issued, replacing the old one, which is securely disposed of.
      - If a refresh request is denied (indicating token revocation or expiry), the SDK will log out the user and prompt for re-authentication.
  
- **Token Expiration Handling**: 
  - The SDK will handle token expiration gracefully by attempting to refresh the token automatically and retrying the API call once before failing. If the refresh fails or the token is still invalid, the SDK will notify the application to prompt a re-login.
- **Security**:
  - Ensure secure handling of tokens:
    - Store tokens securely in client applications.
    - Implement token refresh logic.
  - Prevent exposure of sensitive data in logs or error messages.
- **Documentation**:
  - Provide comprehensive documentation:
    - Usage examples.
    - API references.
    - Best practices.
- **Testing**:
  - Write unit tests using **Jest** to cover all SDK functionalities.
  - Aim for high code coverage and reliability.
- **Installation**:
  - Install the SDK via npm:
    ```bash
    npm install studioflow-auth-sdk
    ```
- **Initialization**
  - Import and initialize the SDK in your application:

    ```javascript
    import AuthSDK from 'studioflow-auth-sdk';

    const auth = new AuthSDK({
      apiBaseUrl: 'https://auth.studioflow.com',
      clientId: 'your_client_id', // if applicable
    });
    ```
- **Configuration Options**

  - **apiBaseUrl**: The base URL for the Auth Service API endpoints.

  - **clientId** (optional): The client identifier if using OAuth flows.

  - **Token Storage**:

    - The SDK handles token storage securely.

    - Options can be provided to customize storage mechanisms if needed.

- **Usage Example**
  - **Login**:

    ```javascript
    auth.login('user@example.com', 'password123!')
      .then(() => {
        // Access token is stored securely in memory
        // Refresh token is managed via HTTP-only cookie
      })
      .catch(error => {
        // Handle error
      });
    ```

  - **Access Protected Resources**:

    ```javascript
    auth.getAccessToken()
      .then(token => {
        // Use token in Authorization header for API requests
        // Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
      })
      .catch(error => {
        // Handle error
      });
    ```

  - **Logout**:

    ```javascript
    auth.logout()
      .then(() => {
        // Access token cleared from memory
        // Server should clear the refresh token cookie
      })
      .catch(error => {
        // Handle error
      });
    ```

## **Failover, Redundancy, and Disaster Recovery**

The StudioFlow Auth Service leverages Google Cloud Platformâ€™s built-in capabilities to ensure high availability, redundancy, and data integrity. Key components include:

1. **Multi-Region Deployment**: Identity Platform and Firestore are deployed in multi-region configurations to prevent single-point failures and ensure service continuity.
2. **Load Balancing and Auto-Scaling**: Google Cloud Load Balancer distributes traffic across regions with automatic failover, while Cloud Functions auto-scale to handle demand, minimizing downtime during traffic spikes.
3. **Scheduled Backups**: Firestore backups are configured to run on a scheduled basis, stored in a separate region. Identity Platform user metadata is mirrored to Firestore to support disaster recovery.
4. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Real-time health checks and alerting through Cloud Monitoring allow proactive response to service issues. Alerts are configured for latency, failures, and storage access problems, helping maintain service availability.

  - **Function Invocations**: Average number per user per month.
  - **Firestore Operations**: Number of reads/writes per user per month.
- **Input into GCP Pricing Calculator**:
  - **Cloud Functions**:
    - Memory allocation per function.
    - Execution time per invocation.
    - Total monthly invocations.
  - **Firestore**:
    - Total document reads, writes, deletes.
    - Data storage size.
  - **Identity Platform**:
    - Usage beyond the free tier.
  - **Cloud Logging & Monitoring**:
    - Log volume and retention.
- **Consider Additional Costs**:
  - **Networking**: Data egress charges if applicable.
  - **Third-Party Services**: Costs for external services.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Clearly state all assumptions.
  - Include a buffer for unexpected spikes.
